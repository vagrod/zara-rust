This is my attempt to rewrite [Zara](https://github.com/vagrod/zara) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

If this ends up well, we'll get quite a useful product.\
This code is **very WIP**. Once it starts to become something, I'll update this readme.

It's half done at the moment.\
The demo is built with `termion` which seems like does not support Windows. Maybe later I'll try find another solution for the demo "UI".
